Place light bulbs on the grid to match the target light levels. If a cell contains <span class="material-symbols-outlined">arrow_upward</span> there is not enough light, if it contains <span class="material-symbols-outlined">arrow_downward</span> there is too much light. The <span class="material-symbols-outlined">equal</span> icon indicates the light level is exactly right.
