<p><b>Goal</b><br>Get the correct number of cells of each type after the simulation ends</p>
<p><b>Step 1: Place cells on the grid</b><br>Place some initial cells on the grid by selecting them at the bottom and then clicking/tapping cells in the grid.</p>
<p><b>Step 2: Simulate</b><br>Press the play button and watch the cells spread according to the arrows indicated. The simulation stops if nothing changes anymore.</p>
<p><b>Step 3: See the result</b><br>Now the number of cells of each type is added up and compared to the numbers below the selection buttons at the bottom. If they are the same, you win!</p>
<p><i>Note: During the simulation, a single spread step is performed row by row, from bottom to top and from left to right.</i></p>
